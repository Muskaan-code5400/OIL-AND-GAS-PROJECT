# OIL-AND-GAS-PROJECT
This project explores the use of machine learning (ML) to solve key challenges within the oil and gas industry, improving efficiency, optimizing operations, and enabling data-driven decision-making. The oil and gas sector generates vast amounts of data from sensors, production logs, and environmental monitoring systems. This project leverages advanced ML techniques to analyze this data, identify patterns, and develop predictive models to enhance various aspects of operations.
